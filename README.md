# javascript-udemy-dice-game

I am currently in the process of completing a Udemy course in JavaScript: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!".

One of the projects to practice manipulating the DOM was to create a browser game called "The Pig Game". I coded along with the tutorials, but I tried to pause often to write the code before the answer was given by the instructor. I deployed the game with netlify, and you may play it here: https://amazing-austin-3ab047.netlify.com/
